# FaceRecognitionKNN

The following project is based on K-Nearest Neighbour approach to recognize faces. It uses [HaarCascadeClassifier](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades_cuda) to recognize faces.

The following [link](https://github.com/Sagn1k/FaceRecognitionKNN/blob/master/face.py) shows how to use your webcam to capture video in Python.

### Final Code:

  [Record Face](//record_faces.py)
  Save different faces everytime.
  
  [Recognize Face](//face_recog.py)

### Prerequisites

##### To install mentioned libraries:

###### Numpy:

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip  
sudo pip install numpy scipy
```

###### Pandas:

Easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

```
sudo pip install pandas
```

Similarly Install [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html), etc.

###### OpenCV:
